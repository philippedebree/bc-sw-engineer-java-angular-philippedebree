**Module 51** · Hands-on exercise · [setup](EXERCISES-INDEX.md)

## Goal

Complete blanks for instructor-hosted OpenShift evidence.

## Steps

### Step 1 — Template

```
Image identity: sha256:_____

```

### Step 2 — Fill

### Step 3 — Not k3s

Taught runtime is instructor OpenShift + `oc`.

## Expected result

Deploy TODOs use oc/Route — not kubectl/k3s.

| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Digest named | Pass / Fail |
| 2 | oc set image / undo | Pass / Fail |
| 3 | Credentials not committed | Pass / Fail |
